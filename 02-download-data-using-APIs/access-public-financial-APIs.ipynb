    "An API (Application Programming Interface) is like a messenger that allows two computer programs to talk to each other. Imagine you're the client (like a web browser or app), and you want some data - like gas prices - from another computer (the server). You send a request over the internet asking for that information. The server receives your request, finds the data, and sends it back. The API is the set of rules that defines how you must ask and what kind of answer you'll get.\n",
